              We are a part of a network of young volunteers from IEEE who aim
              to assist the local community through humanitarian activities and
              sustainable projects by leveraging technology. We seek to involve
              volunteers and local bodies into identifying & understanding the
              real world issues, to be able to find effective and efficient
              solutions by mutual understanding and collaboration. In 2018, the
              SIGHT program was conceptualized and launched under the IEEE AMU
              student branch, with the objective to expose undergraduate
              students to population realities and the corresponding issues
              faced by local communities. Students are thus encouraged to
              develop projects accounting as small steps to be a part of the
              larger picture and making the world a more sustainable place. We
              take pride in being a part of IEEE SIGHT and work for humanitarian
              needs through our teamwork, solidarity & commitment.
